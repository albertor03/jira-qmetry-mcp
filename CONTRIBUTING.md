- **TypeScript**: All code must be in TypeScript
- **ESLint**: Run `pnpm lint` before committing
- **Prettier**: Run `pnpm format` to format code
- **JSDoc**: Document all public functions

#### File Structure

If adding new functionality, follow this structure:

```
src/

‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ qmetry-new-functionality.ts    # API calls
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ interfaces/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ qmetry-new-functionality.ts    # TypeScript types
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tools/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ new-functionality-tools.ts      # MCP definitions
```

# Stage files
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: add support for new QMetry features"

## üìù Style Guides

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
interface TestCaseParams {
  summary: string;
  projectId: number;
  description?: string;
}

export async function createTestCase(
  params: TestCaseParams
): Promise<TestCaseResponse> {
  // Implementation
}

// ‚ùå Bad
function createTestCase(summary, projectId, description) {
  // No types
}
```

### Logging

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
import { logger } from '../utils/logger';

logger.info('Test case created', { testCaseId: '123' }, 'createTestCase');

// ‚ùå Bad
console.log('Test case created');
```

### Error Handling

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
try {
  const result = await apiCall();
  return result;
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Failed to create test case', error, 'createTestCase');
  throw error;
}

// ‚ùå Bad
try {
  return await apiCall();
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}
```
